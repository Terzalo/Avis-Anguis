There's just one demo level for the time being.

Differences with Snakebird mechanics:

- Limited snake length (up to 6 tiles, increasable by adding a few rules)
- Limited number of movable boxes (up to 3, increasable)
- No teleporter yet.
- You have to manually undo last move if a snake died.
- Useless "jumps" straight up are not discarded from history.
