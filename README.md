# Avis Anguis
PuzzleScript port of Snakebird.

[Play here](http://terzalo.com/avis-anguis/ "Play Avis Anguis")

There's just one demo level for the time being.

Differences with Snakebird mechanics:

- Limited number of movable boxes (up to 3, increasable)
- No teleporter yet.
- You have to manually undo last move if a snake died.
- Useless "jumps" straight upward are not discarded from history.
